# Karakulak

Karakulak is the AI helper for the Tekir search engine.

## What?

Karakulak is an Gemini 2.0 based AI agent (just like DDG's DuckAssist) for questions that are searched in the Tekir search engine.

This accelerates searching operations for Tekir's users.

## Installing

You can build and run your own instance with the Bun runtime.

1. Pull this repository:

```bash
$ git pull https://github.com/tekircik/karakulak.git
```

2. Setup the project:

```bash
$ cd karakulak
$ bun install
```

3. Change the `.env.example` file name to `.env` and edit the variables according to your information.
4. Run the project:

```bash
$ bun run start
```

That's it! Your Karakulak instance should be working now.
